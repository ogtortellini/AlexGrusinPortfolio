            I'm a mechanical engineering student with a strong bias toward execution. I work at the intersection of design, analysis, and fabrication, translating complex problems into practical, testable solutions. My approach is grounded in evidence, iteration, and a clear understanding of system behavior—from material properties and thermal limits to control logic and mechanical interfaces.

          <p class="text-lg">
            I combine theoretical knowledge with hands-on ability, equally comfortable modeling in code or troubleshooting hardware. I value clarity, precision, and performance—whether debugging a simulation, refining a design, or tracking down the root cause of failure.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">My Engineering Journey</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        I have known I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life. At first, I was interested in software and computers, intimidated by the math and physics I thought I would have to master in mechanical engineering. My perspective shifted after I built my first car. Having helped my dad with the family's cars before, this was the first time I truly grasped how they worked. For the first time, I felt personally invested in something I was creating, and I’ve been addicted to engineering ever since.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My favorite part about mechanical engineering is how powerful of a tool it is. I work at a student-run maker space called Starforge. It’s not a paid position, but the freedom to be curious and creative that comes from having access to tools and space is invaluable. At Starforge, I can harness the theory and formulas from my studies and turn them into real designs. Some projects I’ve been a part of at Starforge include a hydrogen fuel cell, a hybrid race car, a few robots, and many more. I'm like a little kid at Christmas when I can take part in a real-life implementation of engineering. I am confident that mastering my problem-solving and technical skills as a mechanical engineer will unlock my capacity for creativity.

        When I'm not engineering, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new technologies. This passion for discovery complements my engineering work, driving me to continuously learn and grow.

        I'm looking for opportunities where engineering decisions have consequences—where clean design, deep understanding, and execution under constraints make the difference.
