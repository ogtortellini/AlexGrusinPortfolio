            I'm a mechanical engineering student with a strong bias toward execution. I work at the intersection of design, analysis, and fabrication, translating complex problems into practical, testable solutions. My approach is grounded in evidence, iteration, and a clear understanding of system behavior—from material properties and thermal limits to control logic and mechanical interfaces.

          <p class="text-lg dark:text-gray-200">
            I combine theoretical knowledge with hands-on ability, equally comfortable modeling in code or troubleshooting hardware. I value clarity, precision, and performance—whether debugging a simulation, refining a design, or tracking down the root cause of failure.

      <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 dark:text-gray-100">My Engineering Journey</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4 dark:text-gray-200">
        I have known I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life. At first, I was interested in software and computers, intimidated by the math and physics I thought I would have to master in mechanical engineering. My perspective shifted after I built my first car. Having helped my dad with the family's cars before, this was the first time I truly grasped how they worked. For the first time, I felt personally invested in something I was creating, and I’ve been addicted to engineering ever since.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 dark:text-gray-200">
        My favorite part about mechanical engineering is how powerful of a tool it is. I work at a student-run maker space called Starforge. It’s not a paid position, but the freedom to be curious and creative that comes from having access to tools and space is invaluable. At Starforge, I can harness the theory and formulas from my studies and turn them into real designs. Some projects I’ve been a part of at Starforge include a hydrogen fuel cell, a hybrid race car, a few robots, and many more. I'm like a little kid at Christmas when I can take part in a real-life implementation of engineering. I am confident that mastering my problem-solving and technical skills as a mechanical engineer will unlock my capacity for creativity.

        When I'm not engineering, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new technologies. This passion for discovery complements my engineering work, driving me to continuously learn and grow.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg italic text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
        I'm looking for opportunities where engineering decisions have consequences—where clean design, deep understanding, and execution under constraints make the difference.
