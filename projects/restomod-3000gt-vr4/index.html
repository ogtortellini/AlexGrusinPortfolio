        <p class="text-center text-gray-600 mb-8">This project chronicles my ongoing technical and educational journey in restoring and modifying a 1997 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4. Spanning multiple years, I've taken this car from a rusted, non-functional platform to a high-performance, street-capable machine. Since starting in 2018, the build has involved a full chassis and subframe restoration, two engine rebuilds, a transmission overhaul, and a highly iterative ECU tuning process. For me, this project serves as a hands-on laboratory for learning systems integration, reliability engineering, and motorsport-grade calibration.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 border-b pb-2">1. Introduction & My Early Restoration (2018)</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In June 2018, at age 14, I began this project while visiting family. My initial repairs took place at my uncle's house, where my father and I fixed a leaking rear brake line and restored the AC functionality. Despite my limited experience at the time, I absorbed foundational mechanical skills during these early repairs.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">Afterward, my father and I drove the car 600 miles home. It was in severe disrepair: no air conditioning, holes through the floor, and only a temporary brake line fix. The images below show some of the rust I discovered upon closer inspection.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">That summer, I initiated a full teardown of the undercarriage. I cut out severely rusted floor sections and replaced them with junkyard donor panels, which I then welded in. I removed, stripped, refinished, and reassembled both front and rear subframes with polyurethane bushings, new axles, fresh seals, and rubber lines. This involved removing the old bushings, prepping and painting the subframe, and then reassembling everything.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">By fall 2020, driveability issues led me to initiate a full teardown of the W6MG1 6-speed manual transmission. Symptoms included grinding into 3rd gear, difficulty holding reverse, and hard engagement of 1st. The teardown revealed severely worn synchro friction surfaces on 3rd and reverse, a broken roll pin on the 3/4 shift fork, and wear on 1st/2nd gear teeth and sliders.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">Between November 2020 and April 2021, my dad and I carefully evaluated options. We considered a forged performance rebuild featuring Ross pistons and high-compression gaskets, but ultimately I opted for an OEM-spec configuration due to cost, complexity, and my intended use for the car. My rebuild included a cleaned and honed block (by MMW), a polished OEM crankshaft, stock pistons and rods, a full OEM gasket kit including MLS-style Athena head gaskets, refreshed oil pump, water pump, and timing components. I verified ring gaps and bearing clearances using plastigage and micrometers and carefully torqued and staged ARP main studs. Sourcing good cylinder heads was a challenge, but I found a suitable set from a donor car.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">As of early 2025, my 3000GT VR4 is a testament to years of dedication and learning. It's a fully operational, high-performance vehicle that I regularly enjoy driving. The journey from a neglected shell to its current state has been incredibly rewarding, providing me with invaluable hands-on experience in mechanical engineering, problem-solving, and project management. While any project car is arguably never "finished," the car is now in a reliable and highly enjoyable state. Future plans are modest, focusing on continued maintenance, minor refinements, and perhaps exploring advanced data acquisition for performance analysis. This project has solidified my passion for automotive engineering and has equipped me with a practical skill set that complements my academic studies.</p>
