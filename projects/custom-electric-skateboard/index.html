        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The main goal in designing my own electric skateboard was to create a long-range board suitable for commuting around campus without the need for frequent recharging. To achieve this, I prioritized a high-capacity battery and efficient power management. Other important design considerations included:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Torquey Motors:</strong> Powerful motors were selected to provide strong takeoff acceleration and effective braking, ensuring safety and control in stop-and-go campus environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Large Wheels:</strong> Oversized wheels help the board handle rough terrain, cracks, and uneven surfaces commonly found on outdoor paths.</li>
          <li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> All electronics and enclosures were sealed to allow safe riding on wet roads and in rainy conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Every component was chosen and tested for durability, making the board a dependable daily driver for year-round use.</li>
          <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong> The deck and enclosure materials were chosen for optimal strength-to-weight ratio, balancing performance and portability.</li>
          <li><strong>Ergonomics & Comfort:</strong> The deck shape and grip tape were designed for comfortable long rides and secure footing.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> Custom paint and finish give the board a unique look that stands out on campus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">These considerations guided every step of the design and build process, resulting in a board that is not only practical and reliable, but also fun and visually striking.</p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">To kickstart the build, I sourced key components from a Meepo V4S electric skateboard. Specifically, I reused the wheels, hub motors, and trucks from this board. These parts were chosen because they fit my ergonomic preferences and riding style, providing a familiar and comfortable feel. The Meepo V4S components are known for their reliability and performance, making them an excellent foundation for my custom build.</p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The first major component I designed for this board was a custom battery pack using a 10s2p configuration with Molicel P45B cells. This setup provides 10 cells in series (for a nominal voltage of 36V) and 2 in parallel, resulting in a total of 20 cells. Each P45B cell has a nominal capacity of 4.5Ah, so the pack delivers a total capacity of 9Ah (324Wh at nominal voltage). This high capacity allows for long-range commuting, minimizing the need for frequent recharging and supporting my goal of reliable campus transportation.</p>
