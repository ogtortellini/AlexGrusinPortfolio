          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This project chronicles the journey of transforming a Tesla Cybertruck into a statement piece, commissioned by a client to advertise their virtual power plant business in Texas. The core request was to make the Cybertruck "as Texas as possible," leading to a unique design exploration that balanced bold aesthetics with practical modifications. Initially exploring custom sheet metal body panels, the project evolved towards a distinctive tubular exoskeleton-inspired design, focusing on altering the truck's proportions and enhancing its utility and visual impact. This page details the design iterations, fabrication choices, and the collaborative process that brought this one-of-a-kind Cybertruck to life.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-3">
            The primary motivation for this project was to fulfill a client's vision for a highly customized Cybertruck that would serve as a mobile advertisement for their virtual power plant business (which assists homeowners with Texas's VPP program and installs free home battery backups) and embody a rugged, "Texas" spirit. Key objectives included:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Client Vision:</strong> To create a Cybertruck that is unmistakably unique and "as Texas as possible."</li>
            <li><strong>Aesthetic Transformation:</strong> To significantly alter the Cybertruck's stock bodylines and proportions, particularly addressing the controversial tapering side profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Enhancements:</strong> To incorporate practical elements like a robust roof rack, tool/gear mounting solutions (molle panels), a winch-ready front bumper, and a durable rear bash bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Exploration:</strong> To investigate various customization approaches, from custom sheet metal panels to a full tubular exoskeleton, ultimately refining these ideas into a cohesive and buildable design.</li>
            <li><strong>Showcasing Makerspace Capabilities:</strong> To leverage the team's expertise in CAD design, metal fabrication (cutting, bending, welding), and custom part creation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 border-b pb-2">3. Design Process</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The design process was highly iterative, involving close collaboration with the client to translate their "Texas as possible" vision into a tangible and striking Cybertruck modification. Our team at the makerspace leveraged its fabrication expertise to guide design choices.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3.1 Initial Concepts & Ideation</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The initial brainstorming sessions were broad, with ideas ranging from the audacious (nearly mounting a longhorn skull to the hood) to more conventional modifications. We first proposed redesigning body panels using laser-cut and bent stainless steel sheets to alter the truck's bodylines. However, this approach was deemed not cost-effective and didn't offer a significant enough departure from the OEM design language to meet the client's desire for a truly unique vehicle.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3.2 CAD Modeling & Iteration</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Given our team's familiarity with tube cutting and welding, we pivoted to the concept of a tubular exoskeleton. This offered greater design freedom and the potential for a more radical transformation. Using <strong>Fusion 360</strong>, I dedicated <strong>over 100 hours</strong> to developing three distinct versions of the Cybertruck, exploring different levels of exoskeleton integration and aesthetic styles. (More details on these three versions will be provided later). These designs were presented to the client, and through several collaborative meetings, we refined the vision. Ultimately, a full exoskeleton was deemed too complex, leading us to a hybrid approach. We selectively incorporated key elements from the exoskeleton concepts, such as the roof rack and support structures, to achieve the desired visual impact and functionality. The front bumper design was validated for strength using FEA. (FEA results and screenshots will be added later).

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The primary material chosen for the custom additions was <strong>mild steel tubing</strong> (1/8 inch wall thickness). Specifically, <strong>2-inch Outer Diameter (OD)</strong> tubing was used for the front and rear bumpers due to strength requirements, while <strong>1-inch OD</strong> tubing was selected for the roof rack and ladder for a balance of strength and weight. All custom steel components underwent a thorough finishing process: they were <strong>sandblasted</strong> to prepare the surface and then <strong>powder-coated</strong> for durability and a high-quality aesthetic before final installation. The molle panels were custom fiber-lasered.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3.4 Wheel & Tire Selection</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Achieving the perfect stance and off-road capability required careful consideration of wheel and tire fitment. A significant amount of research and calculation went into selecting options that would complement the Cybertruck's modified aesthetics and performance goals. We analyzed how different wheel sizes and offsets would affect the "poke" – how far the wheels extend from the fenders – compared to the stock setup (55.8mm stock poke).
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
              Several options, primarily featuring <strong>Black Rhino Armory wheels</strong>, were presented to the client:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 my-3">
              <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> 18x9.5 wheels with a -18mm offset, fitted with 35-inch tires. This setup resulted in a poke of 138.65mm (an increase of 82.85mm over stock). The net cost for this package was estimated around $2,295.45 after considering the sale of old wheels.</li>
              <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> 18x9.5 wheels, also with a -18mm offset, but with larger 37-inch tires. This maintained the same poke as Option 1 but offered increased tire height, with an estimated net cost of $2,575.45.</li>
              <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> 20x9.5 wheels with a +6mm offset, also fitted with 37-inch tires. This option provided a poke of 114.65mm (an increase of 58.85mm over stock), offering a slightly more tucked-in look compared to the -18mm offset options. The estimated net cost for this premium setup was $3,095.45.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
              These costs included the wheel and tire package, a spare, and associated expenses like lift rods, ceramic coating, lug nuts, and hub rings, offset by the potential resale value of the original wheels and tires. This detailed breakdown allowed the client to make an informed decision based on aesthetics, performance, and budget.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-3">
            The final design incorporates several custom-fabricated elements that collectively give the Cybertruck a unique, aggressive, and functional "exoskeleton" look:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Elevated Roof Rack:</strong> A prominent 1-inch OD mild steel tube roof rack, originating from the full exoskeleton concepts, drastically shifts up the tapering bodyline, correcting the Cybertruck's side profile proportions and adding significant utility.</li>
            <li><strong>Tailgate-to-Rack Support Struts:</strong> Robust struts connect the tailgate area to the roof rack, enhancing structural rigidity and contributing to the exoskeleton aesthetic.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Molle Panels:</strong> Fiber-lasered molle panels are integrated with the support struts, offering versatile mounting points for tools, off-roading gear, and other accessories.</li>
            <li><strong>Side Access Ladder:</strong> A 1-inch OD mild steel tube ladder is mounted from the roof rack to the side steps, improving accessibility to roof-mounted gear.</li>
            <li><strong>Winch-Ready Front Bumper:</strong> A simplified yet strong 2-inch OD mild steel tube front bumper was designed and validated with FEA, its primary purpose being to securely hold a winch.</li>
            <li><strong>Mad-Max Style Rear Bash Bar:</strong> A distinctive 2-inch OD mild steel tubular rear bash bar, mounting directly to the frame and tow hitch, provides robust protection and a highly aggressive look.</li>
            <li><strong>Cohesive Exoskeleton Appearance:</strong> While not a full, interconnected exoskeleton, the strategic placement and design of these powder-coated tubular components successfully create the visual impression of one.</li>

        <section id="challenges" class="mb-10 scroll-mt-20">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 border-b pb-2">5. Challenges & Solutions</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Translating the client's abstract "as Texas as possible" request into concrete design features while balancing aesthetics, functionality, and a $12,000 budget was an ongoing challenge. The initial pivot from costly sheet metal to more familiar mild steel tubing was a key early solution.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            A significant hurdle emerged with <strong>tube bending</strong>. Our initial plan to retrofit a high-quality manual bender frame with a hydraulic ram from Harbor Freight hit a snag with the bending dies. Professional dies are expensive, and our attempts to create our own using our plasma cutter and 3D printers were ultimately unsuccessful. The custom dies caused <strong>kinking and marring of the tubes</strong>, and while they initially seemed promising, we quickly found they lacked precision and were not durable enough for repeated use, often failing after only one or two bends. We realized too late that the custom bender setup was unsalvageable. With mounting team pressure, as nearly all fabrication was held up, we had no choice but to pivot to a ready-to-go, albeit less robust and slower, manual hobby-level bender. This entire endeavor cost us more than a month, as critical parts could not be ordered or cut until the initial bends were successfully completed. This experience starkly highlighted the value of quality, reliable tools; a dependable tool proved to be worth far more than an innovative but uncertain one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            <strong>Fabrication precision</strong> was another critical challenge. For the rear bumper, we built a jig and relied on engineering drawings to cut each 2-inch OD tube at precise angles (down to 0.1 degrees) with our pipe cutter before tacking the main hoops and fitting the angled supports. The front bumper tubes were cut and bent, but final tacking was delayed until the winch mounting angle was confirmed. The roof rack, being the largest and most complex assembly (using 1-inch OD tubing), demanded the most refinement. Despite using engineering drawings, the initial welded top and bottom hoops were neither identical nor internally symmetric. This necessitated multiple cycles of cutting, adjusting, and re-welding, using digital levels and laser guides to finally achieve the required straightness and symmetry.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            The project also included a <strong>full vehicle vinyl wrap</strong>. Taking a week-long "break" from metal fabrication, two of us (with occasional help) undertook this task. It was my first experience wrapping an entire vehicle, and it proved to be a steep learning curve with many mistakes made along the way. The wrap installation alone took approximately 30 hours.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <strong>The custom Cybertruck project is now complete, and the vehicle is finished and on the road.</strong> It successfully fulfills the client's vision, serving as a unique promotional vehicle that is fully functional for off-road use and undeniably "turns heads everywhere it goes."
            The project underscored the importance of iterative design (with over 100 hours in CAD alone), the necessity of clear client communication, and the strategic advantage of leveraging existing team strengths. The transition from complex CAD models to a physically manufactured product, especially with fabrication challenges like tube bending and achieving precision on large welded assemblies like the roof rack, provided invaluable hands-on experience. The first-time experience with a full vehicle vinyl wrap also added a new skillset and appreciation for that craft.
