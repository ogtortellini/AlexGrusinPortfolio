          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This project chronicles the journey of transforming a Tesla Cybertruck into a statement piece, commissioned by a client to advertise their virtual power plant business in Texas. The core request was to make the Cybertruck "as Texas as possible," leading to a unique design exploration that balanced bold aesthetics with practical modifications. Initially exploring custom sheet metal body panels, the project evolved towards a distinctive tubular exoskeleton-inspired design, focusing on altering the truck's proportions and enhancing its utility and visual impact. This page details the design iterations, fabrication choices, and the collaborative process that brought this one-of-a-kind Cybertruck to life.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-3">
            The primary impetus for this project was to realize a client’s vision for a purpose-built Cybertruck that functions as a mobile marketing platform for their virtual power plant services—supporting Texas homeowners through the VPP program and offering complimentary home battery installations—while conveying a distinctive, rugged Texan aesthetic. Key objectives included:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Client Vision:</strong> To create a Cybertruck that is unmistakably unique and "as Texas as possible."</li>
            <li><strong>Aesthetic Transformation:</strong> To significantly alter the Cybertruck's stock bodylines and proportions, particularly addressing the controversial tapering side profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Enhancements:</strong> To incorporate practical elements like a robust roof rack, tool/gear mounting solutions (molle panels), a winch-ready front bumper, and a durable rear bash bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Exploration:</strong> To investigate various customization approaches, from custom sheet metal panels to a full tubular exoskeleton, ultimately refining these ideas into a cohesive and buildable design.</li>
            <li><strong>Showcasing Makerspace Capabilities:</strong> To leverage the team's expertise in CAD design, metal fabrication (cutting, bending, welding), and custom part creation.</li>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 border-b pb-2">3. Design Process</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The design process was highly iterative, involving close collaboration with the client to translate their "Texas as possible" vision into a tangible and striking Cybertruck modification. After initial concepts involving custom sheet metal body panels proved less than ideal for the client's goals and budget, we pivoted to a tubular structure approach, leveraging our team's familiarity with tube cutting and welding. This offered greater design freedom and the potential for a more radical transformation. Using <strong>Fusion 360</strong>, I dedicated <strong>over 100 hours</strong> to developing three distinct initial versions of the Cybertruck, exploring different levels of exoskeleton integration. This extensive CAD work formed the foundation for the detailed component designs that followed. All custom steel components were standardized to be sandblasted and then powder-coated in textured black for durability and a cohesive aesthetic. The strategic placement and design of these powder-coated tubular components successfully create the visual impression of a cohesive exoskeleton, fulfilling the client's "Texas as possible" vision.

              Achieving the perfect stance and off-road capability required careful consideration of wheel and tire fitment. A significant amount of research and calculation went into selecting options that would complement the Cybertruck's modified aesthetics and performance goals. We analyzed how different wheel sizes and offsets would affect the "poke" – how far the wheels extend from the fenders – compared to the stock setup (55.8mm stock poke).
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
              Several options, primarily featuring <strong>Black Rhino Armory wheels</strong>, were presented to the client:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 my-3">
              <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> 18x9.5 wheels with a -18mm offset, fitted with 35-inch tires. This setup resulted in a poke of 138.65mm (an increase of 82.85mm over stock). The net cost for this package was estimated around $2,295.45 after considering the sale of old wheels.</li>
              <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> 18x9.5 wheels, also with a -18mm offset, but with larger 37-inch tires. This maintained the same poke as Option 1 but offered increased tire height, with an estimated net cost of $2,575.45.</li>
              <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> 20x9.5 wheels with a +6mm offset, also fitted with 37-inch tires. This option provided a poke of 114.65mm (an increase of 58.85mm over stock), offering a slightly more tucked-in look compared to the -18mm offset options. The estimated net cost for this premium setup was $3,095.45.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
              These costs included the wheel and tire package, a spare, and associated expenses like lift rods, ceramic coating, lug nuts, and hub rings, offset by the potential resale value of the original wheels and tires. This detailed breakdown allowed the client to make an informed decision based on aesthetics, performance, and budget.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Translating the client's abstract "as Texas as possible" request into concrete design features while balancing aesthetics, functionality, and a $12,000 budget was an ongoing challenge. The initial pivot from costly sheet metal to more familiar mild steel tubing was a key early solution.

          <div class="mt-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold">Tube Bending Difficulties</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-1">
              A significant hurdle emerged with <strong>tube bending</strong>. Our initial plan to retrofit a high-quality manual bender frame with a hydraulic ram from Harbor Freight hit a snag with the bending dies. Professional dies are expensive, and our attempts to create our own using our plasma cutter and 3D printers were ultimately unsuccessful. The custom dies caused <strong>kinking and marring of the tubes</strong>. This entire endeavor cost us more than a month.
            </p>
            <!-- No specific image for "kinking", but can show fabrication involving bent tubes -->

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold">Fabrication Precision</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-1">
              <strong>Fabrication precision</strong> was another critical challenge. For the rear bumper, we built a jig and relied on engineering drawings. The roof rack, being the largest and most complex assembly, demanded the most refinement. This necessitated multiple cycles of cutting, adjusting, and re-welding.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-1">
              The project also included a <strong>full vehicle vinyl wrap</strong>. Taking a week-long "break" from metal fabrication, two of us (with occasional help) undertook this task. It was my first experience wrapping an entire vehicle, and it proved to be a steep learning curve.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <strong>The custom Cybertruck project is now complete, and the vehicle is finished and on the road.</strong> It successfully fulfills the client's vision, serving as a unique promotional vehicle that is fully functional for off-road use and undeniably "turns heads everywhere it goes."
            The project underscored the importance of iterative design (with over 100 hours in CAD alone), the necessity of clear client communication, and the strategic advantage of leveraging existing team strengths. The transition from complex CAD models to a physically manufactured product, especially with fabrication challenges like tube bending and achieving precision on large welded assemblies like the roof rack, provided invaluable hands-on experience. The first-time experience with a full vehicle vinyl wrap also added a new skillset and appreciation for that craft.
